# LeafyGreen MCP-UI POC Context

## Primary Purpose

This codebase is a **proof-of-concept** for an MCP-UI tool (`augmentWithUI.ts`) that augments MCP Server tool responses with UIResources. These UIResources point to mapped URLs where embeddable UIs are hosted.

## Package Roles

### Core Package (`mcp-ui-core`)

- **Primary deliverable**: Contains `augmentWithUI.ts` - the core function that augments MCP Server tool responses with UIResources
- This is the POC being developed and tested

### UI Hosting (`mcp-ui-app`)

- Next.js application hosting embeddable UIs
- Each route corresponds to a tool's embeddable UI component
- Receives render data via postMessage protocol

### Testing/Demo Packages

- **`mcp-server`**: Mock MCP server for testing/demonstration
- **`mcp-client`**: Mock MCP client for testing/demonstration
- These are NOT production code - only for POC validation

### Reference Implementation (`mongodb-mcp-server`)

- Clone of the actual MongoDB MCP Server
- Represents the real MCP server that will eventually integrate with `augmentWithUI`
- Used as reference for understanding integration patterns

## Documentation

- **`TECH_SPEC.md`**: Technical specification for the real implementation work
- Contains architecture, patterns, and integration details for production implementation

## Key Context

- This is a POC/prototype - focus is on validating the `augmentWithUI` concept
- The mock server/client packages exist only to test the augmentation flow
- The MongoDB MCP Server clone shows what the real integration will look like
- Production implementation details are in TECH_SPEC.md
